# Magic-8-Balls

This is an app which is very similar to Dicee app. This is an app that we can change the answers in a random manner by pressing ask button. Thus, Magic 8 Balls have behaviour and functionality. I linked the images and button to ViewController by using IBActions and IBOutlets. I also benefited from Swift constants, variables, and arrays. Arrays in this app are crucial in order to use the ball images. In addition, I used randomisation to generate random ball images in the app. In connection with this, I benefited from array index and the range operators as well. Along with Magic 8 Balls app, you can answer all your difficult questions easily, just ask question and see what magic balls give an answer you!
